## Problem and Background

\begin{columns}
\begin{column}{0.48\textwidth}
Smoking by youth and young adults can cause serious and potentially deadly health issues immediately and into adulthood. Young people who smoke are in danger of:

- addiction to nicotine

- reduced lung growth

- reduced lung function

- early cardiovascular damage

## Problem and Background

- Preventing tobacco use among the youth population is critical.

- Tobacco tax increases are one of the most effective ways to reduce smoking and other tobacco use.

- So, whether higher tax burden will result in a decrease in tobacco sales and uses among youth?


## Research Design

- Explore the relationship between the tax burden on tobacco and the use of youth tobacco use (contolling for state and year)

- Use different graphs and tables to visualize the topics regarding youth tobacco sales, legislations of youth access, tax burden on tobacco, youth tobacco use pattern.

## Methods and Tools

- For data processing: package"tidyverse"

- For visualizations: package"ggplot2", "kableExtra"

- For statistical analysis: package"plm", "stargazer", "gplots"

## Results

- Tax Burden on Tobacco by State, 1999 - 2014
```{r, echo=FALSE}
##Tax on tabacco
Tax_data1 <- Tax %>%
  select(StateAbbr = LocationAbbr, State = LocationDesc, Year, SubMeasureDesc, Data_Value, Data_Value_Type) %>%
  filter(Year >= 1999 & Year <= 2014, SubMeasureDesc == "Federal and State Tax per pack")

##Graph
ggplot(Tax_data1, aes(x = Year, y = Data_Value)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", fill = "#e6e8fa") +
  geom_smooth(method="loess", colour="#007aa5") +
  geom_vline(xintercept=2006, colour="steelblue", linetype="dashed") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(1999,2006,2014)) +
  facet_wrap( ~ State, ncol=6) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x ="Year", y = "Federal and State Tax Per Pack in Dollars",
       caption="Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(color = "black", size = 12, face = "bold"),
  plot.caption = element_text(color = "black", size = 9, face = "italic"),
  axis.text=element_text(size=10))
```

## Results

- Youth Tobacco Sales From 1999 to 2014
```{r, echo = FALSE}
#Data processing
Sales_data1 <- Sales %>%
  select( StateAbbr = LocationAbbr, State = LocationDesc, Year = 'FFY Year', Sales = Data_Value) %>%
  filter(Year >= 1999 & Year <= 2014)
#Heatmap
ggplot(Sales_data1, aes(Year, State)) +
  geom_tile(aes(fill = Sales), colour = "white") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "#e6e8fa", high = "#007aa5") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1999,2014,3)) +
  guides(fill=guide_legend(title="The Proportion of Youtu Tobacco Sales")) +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(x ="Year", y = "",
       caption="Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention")
```

## Results
- Legislation to youth access

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=4.2,fig.height=3, fig.align='center'}

  count(Provision) %>%
  spread(key = Provision, value = n)

## Limitations

- Unable to find datasets on other factors that may contribute to youth tobacco use 

- Not enough covariates that we could include in the regression model - limited internal validity

## Next Steps

- To explore the effect of legislation for youth access to tobacco

- To explore the amount of tax that can encourage quitting among youth smokers
