## Problem and Background

\begin{columns}
\begin{column}{0.48\textwidth}

- addiction to nicotine

- reduced lung growth

- reduced lung function

- early cardiovascular damage

## Problem and Background

- Preventing tobacco use among the youth population is critical.

- Tobacco tax increases are one of the most effective ways to reduce smoking and other tobacco use.

- So, whether higher tax burden will result in a decrease in tobacco sales and uses among youth?


## Research Design

- Explore the relationship between the tax burden on tobacco and the use of youth tobacco use (contolling for state and year)

- Use different graphs and tables to visualize the topics regarding youth tobacco sales, legislations of youth access, tax burden on tobacco, youth tobacco use pattern.
